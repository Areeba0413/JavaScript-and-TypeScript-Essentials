//Local Variable
//A local variable is a "private" variable defined inside a function. 
//It can only be used inside the function where it is defined. It is private and hidden 
//from other functions and other scripting code and cannot be changed by other scripting code.

//Global Variable
//A global variable is a "public" variable defined outside a function. 
//In a web page, global variables belong to the page.
//Global variables can be used (or changed) by all scripts in the page.
//Undeclared variables (created without a keyword var, let, const), are always global, 
//even if they are created inside a function.

//Variable Lifetime
//Global variables live until the page is discarded, like when you navigate to another page or 
//close the window.

//Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is invoked, 
//and deleted when the function is finished.

                                //Closure
//A closure is when a function "remembers" variables from its outer scope, 
// even after the outer function has finished executing.

//A closure is a function that has access to the parent scope, after the parent function 
// has closed.

//closures used to:
//Create private variables
//Preserve state between function calls
